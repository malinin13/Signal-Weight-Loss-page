                        Do I have to take The Signal Pill for the rest of my life to keep the weight off?
                        <ul class="question-answer answer-showed">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Do I have to take The Signal Pill for the rest of my life to keep the weight off?</h4>
                                Absolutely not! My goal is to get you off pills forever! However, The Signal Pill contains the most expensive and bioavailable form of B12. B12 is the one nutrient that a plant-based diet lacks. It's a surface nutrient that we wash off our food, so supplementation is required. You can take The Signal Pill for as long as you like; I take three every day to ensure I get enough B12.                         </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        Can I use The Signal Pill as a meal replacement?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Can I use The Signal Pill as a meal replacement?</h4>
                                NO! Skipping meals and dieting are what destroys your metabolism. With The Signal Method, you get full on foods that are high in volume and low in calories.                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        What's in The Signal Pill that makes it work?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>What's in The Signal Pill that makes it work?</h4>
                                The Signal Pill is a proprietary blend of starches and plant-based ingredients that have been clinically tested to alleviate hunger and restore the normal appetite-signaling mechanism.  Brown rice, oat and barley are the workhorses of our program, and by no coincidence, they are the grains of civilization.                          </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        How did you develop The Signal Pill and Method?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>How did you develop The Signal Pill and Method?</h4>
                                I’m a living testimonial to this way of life. I’m a massive overeater. The fast-food industry destroyed my body with their pharmaceutical-grade and addictive fake foods. I studied plant-based nutrition at Cornell University and learned how the body stores calories. I've also read thousands of studies on weight loss. I've pulled together the most credible research on individual foods and put them to work in one pill. In addition, I created a livable method that everyone can follow, myself included.

                    <li class="question">
                        How many pills are in each bottle?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>How many pills are in each bottle?</h4>
                                There are 90 pills in each bottle. That means you can take three a day for a month. You should take one before each meal with enough water to speed it to your intestines. This is where it interacts with your vagus nerve signaling your brain that you've eaten.
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        How many pills can I take in one day?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>How many pills can I take in one day?</h4>
                                That is a question you won’t have to worry about. The Signal Pill is very effective. Even if you double dose, you won’t be craving any food. The plant-based ingredients are purity assured.
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        How long does The Signal Pill last?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>How long does The Signal Pill last?</h4>
                                When followed by a good meal, your hunger will be abated for 3 to 4 hours. If you indulge in Signal-blocking foods, like ones high in sugar, fat or animal protein, you may need to follow the meal with The Signal Pill, too. Why? Because The Signal Pill contains what your system was actually craving!
                                <br/> <br/>
                                Don't have time to eat? Although it is not recommended, you can pop The Signal Pill without a meal to control your hunger for 1 to 2 hours. Please remember to eat though. You don't want your metabolism to prepare for a famine!                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        Why do I need to drink water with The Signal Pill?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Why do I need to drink water with The Signal Pill?</h4>
                                Without adequate water The Signal Pill could stay trapped in your throat or stomach and never make it to its intended destination, which is the lining of your intestine where starch receptors are patiently awaiting its arrival. About 10 oz. of water will ensure it is flushed through your stomach.
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        Is it expensive to follow The Signal Pill?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Is it expensive to follow the Signal Method?</h4>
                                Only when you consider the cost of all the new skinny clothes you're going to have to buy. We recommend donating your old clothes to charity immediately and never looking back!
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        Do I have to stop eating meat, dairy and oil for The Signal Pill to work?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Do I have to stop eating meat, dairy and oil for The Signal Pill to work?</h4>
                                No, not at all. The healthiest people in the world tolerate about 10% of their diet from animal products. Unfortunately our environment has become very polluted, and animal products now contain staggering amounts of pesticides and environmental contaminates. It's best to limit them as much as possible.
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="question">
                        What if The Signal Pill doesn't work for me?
                        <ul class="question-answer">
                            <li>
                                <h4>What if The Signal Pill doesn't work for me?</h4>
                                For the vast majority, The Signal Pill will work instantly. However, if you’ve had a lifetime dose of pharmaceutical-grade processed foods working to destroy your hunger signal, it might take some time. “Once you pop you just can’t stop” is a popular food jingle that shows how brazen food companies are at keeping you addicted to their product. If you consider yourself a stubborn case, you need to stick with it for at least six weeks and do your best to learn the Signal Method to detox from a lifetime of processed food. We promise to stick with you and help you gain control of your hunger signal.
